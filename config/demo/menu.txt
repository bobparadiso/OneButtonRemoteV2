#This file defines menus, the options within a menu, and settings.
#All COMMENT (ignored) lines start with a "#".
#All MENU lines start with a "!".
#All OPTION lines start with a "*".
#Empty lines are skipped over but make reading by humans easier.
#The parts of any line are separated by a ",".
#The first part of any line gives the NAME, which is what is spoken aloud and shown on the screen when in the menu.
#The first MENU line defines the name of the 'main' menu.
#The 'main' menu does not get any OPTION lines after it, they are dynamically created based on the menus that follow.
#For all other menus, the OPTION lines immediately after define the options for that menu.
#The number after a menu NAME is the IR transmitter ID used for all options in that menu. There may be multiple transmitters to hit devices in various locations easier.

#All OPTIONS have a type:
#once: send the IR code once
#---IR code to send
#hold: send the IR code for as long as button is held down
#---minimum number of times to send code even if button is released
#---delay placed in between IR code sends
#number: user selects a specified number of digits (for a channel, station, etc.)
#---IR code name prefix for all digits sent
#---number of digits
#---delay placed in between digit IR code sends
